Solution: Get more testnet BNB from faucet
```

### **"Oracle agent not authorized"**
```
Solution: Run authorize-oracle.js script again
```

### **"API key invalid"**
```

npm run oracle:start

# Terminal 3: Watch events
cd contracts
npx hardhat console --network bnbTestnet

# Terminal 4: Watch transactions
# Visit: https://testnet.bscscan.com
```

### **Debug Issues**
```bash
# Check oracle status
npm run oracle:status

# View recent resolutions
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/oracle

# Check contract on explorer
# Visit: https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/YOUR_CONTRACT
```
