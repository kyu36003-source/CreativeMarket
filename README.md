> **Predict creative outcomes. AI judges. You win.**

The first prediction market built for designers, musicians, and creators. No crypto knowledge needed.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

---

## The Problem

Traditional prediction markets can't handle subjective outcomes:
- ❌ "Will this logo design be approved?" → Can't verify
- ❌ "Will this track go viral?" → No on-chain data  
- ❌ "Will this NFT collection sell out?" → Manual resolution takes days

UMA's Optimistic Oracle takes **24-48 hours**. Disputes cost $$$. Creative markets are stuck.

---

## Our Solution

**AI judges creative work in under 30 minutes.**

```typescript
// Example: Design contest prediction market
const market = {
  question: "Will Client XYZ approve this logo design?",
  deadline: "2025-10-30",
  judging: "AI analyzes: brand fit, aesthetics, feedback patterns"
}

// 25 minutes later...
// ✅ Resolution: APPROVED (94% confidence)
// Evidence: IPFS stored, verifiable, transparent
```

### Why It Works

1. **AI Oracle** - Claude analyzes designs, music, content against criteria
2. **Gasless Trading** - Your users never see gas fees
3. **Instant Liquidity** - Pool across all creative markets = better odds
