# ✅ Deployment Setup Complete!

## What Was Fixed

The `npm run deploy:testnet` command is now available! I've:

1. ✅ Added deployment scripts to `package.json`
2. ✅ Created `.env` file in `contracts/` directory
3. ✅ Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
4. ✅ Verified hardhat configuration for BSC

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Available Commands

```bash
# Testing
npm test                    # Run all smart contract tests
npm run compile             # Compile contracts

# Deployment
npm run deploy:testnet      # Deploy to BSC Testnet
npm run deploy:mainnet      # Deploy to BSC Mainnet

# Alternative (from contracts directory)
npm run contracts:deploy:testnet
npm run contracts:deploy:mainnet
```

---

## 📝 Before You Deploy

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `contracts/.env`:

```bash
# Get from MetaMask: Account Details > Export Private Key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Get from https://bscscan.com/myapikey
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** 
- Never share your private key
- The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- Use a test wallet for testnet deployment

### 2. Get Test BNB

Visit [BSC Testnet Faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart) and request ~0.5 tBNB

### 3. Deploy!

```bash
npm run deploy:testnet
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Deployment)

1. **Add your private key to `.env`**
   ```bash
   nano contracts/.env
   # Add: PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Add BscScan API key**
   - Get from: https://bscscan.com/myapikey
   - Add to `.env`: `BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_key`

3. **Get test BNB**
   - Visit: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
   - Request 0.5 tBNB

4. **Deploy!**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:testnet
   ```

### After Deployment

1. **Verify contracts on BscScan**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <ARGS>
   ```

2. **Update frontend with contract addresses**
   - Edit `src/lib/contracts/addresses.ts`
   - Add deployed contract addresses

3. **Test on testnet**
   - Create test markets
   - Place test bets
   - Test resolution & claiming

## 💡 Quick Help

### Error: "Missing script: deploy:testnet"
**Fixed!** ✅ Run `npm run` to see all available scripts

### Error: "insufficient funds"
**Solution:** Get test BNB from the faucet

### Error: "invalid private key"
**Solution:** Check `.env` file has correct private key (no spaces, no 0x prefix)

### Error: "network not configured"
**Solution:** BSC Testnet is already configured in `hardhat.config.js`
