## 🔐 Security Validation

### ReentrancyGuard Protection
- ✅ All state-modifying functions protected
- ✅ Prevents reentrancy attacks on:
  - buyPosition()
  - claimWinnings()
  - withdrawPlatformFees()

### Access Control
- ✅ Ownable pattern implemented
- ✅ Oracle authorization system functional
- ✅ Unauthorized access properly rejected

### Input Validation
- ✅ Zero address checks
- ✅ Deadline validation (must be future)
- ✅ Question string validation (non-empty)
- ✅ Bet amount validation (> 0)

### State Management
- ✅ Market resolution prevents further bets
- ✅ Double-claim prevention working
- ✅ Platform fee properly tracked

## 📝 Notes

### Known Limitations
- Contract assumes ETH/BNB as payment token (no ERC20 support yet)
- Platform fee is hardcoded at 2% (not configurable)
- No pause/emergency stop mechanism

2. Implement configurable platform fee
3. Add emergency pause functionality
4. Create dispute resolution mechanism
5. Add timelock for admin operations
6. Implement governance for oracle management

- **Network:** Hardhat Local (ephemeral)
- **Accounts:** 10 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each
- **Block Time:** Instant (no mining delay)
- **Forking:** None (pure local testing)
