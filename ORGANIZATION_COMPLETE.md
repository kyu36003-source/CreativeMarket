## 📊 What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Documentation Organization

**Before**: 35+ markdown files scattered in root directory  
**After**: Organized into `docs/` with clear categories

```
docs/
├── README.md                     # Documentation hub
├── guides/                       # 6 user guides
├── fixes/                        # 11 technical fixes
├── hackathon/                    # 5 competition docs
├── archive/                      # 3 old versions
└── [status files]                # 11 project summaries
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to find relevant documentation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Historical docs preserved in archive
- Single source of truth (docs/README.md)

### 2. ✅ Scripts Organization

**Before**: 2 shell scripts in root directory  
**After**: Centralized in `scripts/` with documentation

```
scripts/
├── README.md                     # Scripts documentation
├── setup.sh                      # Project setup
└── verify-features.sh            # Feature verification
```

**Benefits**:
- All utilities in one place
- Documented usage and troubleshooting
- Easy to add new scripts
- Executable permissions preserved

### 3. ✅ Project Documentation

**New Files Created**:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Complete contribution guidelines
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Detailed structure explanation
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- `contracts/README.md` - Smart contract documentation
- `scripts/README.md` - Scripts documentation

**Benefits**:
- Clear onboarding path for new developers
- Self-documenting codebase
- Consistent coding standards
- Easy maintenance

### 4. ✅ Configuration Cleanup

**Updated**:
- `.gitignore` - Removed hardcoded files, added patterns
- `README.md` - Added links to new documentation
- `package.json` - Already well organized

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner git history
- No accidental commits of build artifacts
- Professional appearance
