# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide - Fixed & Ready!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

This project has been converted from **mock/fake implementation** to **real BSC Testnet deployment**:

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Build Errors** - Fixed import paths in `useContracts.ts`
2. ✅ **Mock AI** - Replaced with real OpenAI GPT-4 API
3. ✅ **Environment Config** - Created proper `.env.local` template
4. ✅ **Contract Addresses** - Ready to update after deployment
5. ✅ **Deployment Scripts** - Working Hardhat deployment for BSC Testnet

## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### **Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Node.js v18+ installed
- [ ] MetaMask wallet with testnet BNB
- [ ] OpenAI API key
- [ ] Pinata API keys
- [ ] WalletConnect project ID

### **Step 1: Get Required Keys (15 mins)**

1. **Testnet BNB** (FREE): https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
2. **WalletConnect ID** (FREE): https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
3. **OpenAI API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (add $5-10 credit)
4. **Pinata Keys** (FREE): https://app.pinata.cloud/keys

### **Step 2: Configure Environment (2 mins)**

Edit `.env.local` and add your keys:

```bash
# Required keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_id
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret
```

Also edit `contracts/.env`:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere
```

### **Step 3: Run Automated Deployment (5 mins)**

```bash
# One-command deployment!
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Compile smart contracts
- ✅ Deploy to BSC Testnet
- ✅ Update contract addresses
- ✅ Build the frontend

### **Step 4: Start the App (1 min)**

Open **two terminals**:

**Terminal 1 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - AI Oracle:**
```bash
npm run oracle:start
```

### **Step 5: Test It! (5 mins)**

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Connect MetaMask (BSC Testnet)
3. Create a test market
4. Place a bet
5. Wait for AI resolution
6. Claim winnings!

## 📋 Manual Deployment (If Automated Script Fails)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
cd contracts && npm install && cd ..
```

### Compile Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile
cd ..
```

### Deploy to BSC Testnet
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet
```

**Copy the contract addresses from output!**

### Update Frontend Addresses

Edit `src/lib/contracts/addresses.ts` - Update Chain ID 97 section:

```typescript
97: {
  PREDICTION_MARKET: '0xYourAddress',
  AI_ORACLE: '0xYourAddress',
  GASLESS_RELAYER: '0xYourAddress',
}
```

### Build & Run

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev        # Terminal 1
npm run oracle:start  # Terminal 2
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] App loads at localhost:3000
- [ ] Can connect MetaMask to BSC Testnet
- [ ] Can create a market
- [ ] Can place bets (YES/NO)
- [ ] Oracle service shows in Terminal 2
- [ ] Market resolves automatically
- [ ] Can claim winnings
- [ ] BNB balance updates correctly

---

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

**Check contracts on BSCScan Testnet:**
```
https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

**Verify contracts (optional):**
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet <ADDRESS>
```

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

**Testnet (FREE):**
- Contract deployment: 0.02 BNB (from faucet)
- All transactions: FREE testnet BNB
- Only cost: OpenAI API (~$0.10-0.30 per resolution)

**Mainnet (Real costs):**
- Deployment: ~$6-8
- Per transaction: ~$0.10-0.30
- OpenAI: ~$0.10-0.30 per resolution

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Insufficient funds"
**Solution:** Get more testnet BNB from faucet

### "Wrong network"
**Solution:** Switch MetaMask to BSC Testnet (Chain ID: 97)

### "Module not found"
**Solution:** 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### "OpenAI API Error"
**Solution:** Check API key is valid and has credits

### Build warnings about linting
**Solution:** These are just warnings, app will work fine. Ignore them.
