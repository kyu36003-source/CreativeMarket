## 💡 Test Scenarios Validated

### Scenario 1: Complete Market Lifecycle
1. ✅ Create market with question, category, end time
2. ✅ Multiple users place bets (YES/NO)
3. ✅ Odds update dynamically based on bet amounts
4. ✅ Market ends (time-based)
5. ✅ Oracle resolves market with outcome
6. ✅ Winners claim proportional winnings
7. ✅ Platform fee deducted correctly

### Scenario 2: User Hedging
1. ✅ User1 bets 2.0 ETH on YES
2. ✅ User1 also bets 0.5 ETH on NO (hedging)
3. ✅ Both positions tracked separately
4. ✅ Winnings calculated for each position

### Scenario 3: Security & Validation
1. ✅ Cannot bet on resolved markets
2. ✅ Cannot resolve before market end time
3. ✅ Only authorized oracles can resolve
4. ✅ Cannot claim winnings twice
5. ✅ Minimum bet amount enforced
6. ✅ ReentrancyGuard prevents attacks
